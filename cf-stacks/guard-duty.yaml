# Version 1.0 - Initial version
#               It doesn't seem to be possible to configure logging to S3
#               bucket via CFN/API at the moment (S3 logging is a fairly
#               new GuardDuty feature. CFN/API support might come later).
#               So right now, after running the CFN, we need to go into the
#               account's GuardDuty settings and:
#                 - Enable S3 logging
#                 - Select the bucket created by this CFN
#                 - Select the KMS key created by this CFN
